	<p>Welcome to my personal website. This website is intended to give a quick
    introduction of my background, interests, and projects that I have been
    working on. I know this is a very simple website but hey, there's only
    so many hours in a day. I'm taking a bunch of courses and have like three
    jobs, so I can't do everything that I want - like make a super cool website.
    But I digress.. Anyway, if you are a potential employer, feel free to browse
    the page and reach out to me regarding any employment opportunities.
    Thank you for visiting.
